#### The Pebble Watchface

Coded in (aproximately) a quarter hour (after doing the sdk install for about half an hour). My first watchface is born. Just a background image and the time, nothing fancy.

Do whatever you want with it, but please don't make me responsible for any damage to your watch ;-)
Oh, and of course all trademarks are property of their respective owners, and so onâ€¦

Now, as i've warned you, grab your precompiled watchface by navigation to:
